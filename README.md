Super-Simple Node Example
===

This is a sample express setup with just slightly more functionality than you
get by just running `express` at the command line. The root route explains some
simple EJS functionality; going to '/anything' will give you an example of a
variable route. At some point I might make this into a basic tutorial for
setting up a web page, including databasing and cluster and namespacing and all
kinds of fun stuff. If you're lucky.
