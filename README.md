Super-Simple Node Example
===

This is a sample express setup with just slightly more functionality than you get by just running `express` at the command line:

  * The root route explains some simple EJS functionality.

  * Going to '/posts' will give you a simple example of interacting with a database, assuming you have mongo set up correctly.

  * Going to any other top-level path will give you an example of a variable route.

At some point I might make this into a basic tutorial for setting up a web page, including cluster and namespacing and all kinds of fun stuff. If you're lucky.
